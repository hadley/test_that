* Ignore attributes in `is_true` and `is_false` (#49)

* `make_expectation` works for more types of input (#52)

* Now works better with evaluate 0.4.3.

* new `fail()` function always forces a failure in a test. Suggested by 
  Richie Cotton (#47)

* Added `TapReporter` to produce output compatible with the "test anything 
  protocol". Contributed by Dan Keshet.

* Fixed where `auto_test` would identify the wrong files as having changed. 
  (Thanks to Peter Meilstrup)

* `auto_test_package` uses `devtools` to load packages and looks in
  `inst/tests` by default for test files. (Contributed by Peter
  Meilstrup)

Version 0.7
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `SummaryReporter`: still return informative messages even if no tests
  defined (just bare expectations). (Fixes #31)

* Improvements to reference classes (Thanks to John Chambers)

* Bug fixes for when nothing was generated in `gives_warning` /
  `shows_message`. (Thanks to Bernd Bischl)

* New `make_expectation` function to programmatically generate an equality
  expectation. (Fixes #24)

* `SummaryReporter`: You don't get praise until you have some tests.

* Depend on `methods` rather than requiring it so that testthat works when run
  from `Rscript`

* `auto_test` now normalises paths to enable better identification of file
  changes, and fixes bug in instantiating new reporter object.

Version 0.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* All `mutatr` classes have been replaced with ReferenceClasses.

* Better documentation for short-hand expectations.

* `test_dir` and `test_package` gain new `filter` argument which allows you to
   restrict which tests are run.

Version 0.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* bare expectations now correctly throw errors again

Changes in version 0.4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* autotest correctly loads code and executes tests in same environment

* contexts are never closed before they are opened, and always closed at the
  end of file

* fixed small bug in `test_dir` where each test was not given its own
  environment

* all `expect_*` short cut functions gain a label argument, thanks to Steve
  Lianoglou

Changes in version 0.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* all expectations now have a shortcut form, so instead of 
     expect_that(a, is_identical_to(b))
  you can do
     expect_identical(a, b)

* new shows_message and gives_warning expectations to test warnings and
  messages

* expect_that, equals, is_identical_to and is_equivalent to now have
  additional label argument which allows you to control the appearance of the
  text used for the expected object (for expect_that) and actual object (for
  all other functions) in failure messages. This is useful when you have loops
  that run tests as otherwise all the variable names are identical, and it's
  difficult to tell which iteration caused the failure.

* executing bare tests gives nicer output

* all expectations now give more information on failure to make it easier to
  track down the problem.

* test_file and test_dir now run in code in separate environment to avoid
  pollution of global environment. They also temporary change the working 
  directory so tests can use relative paths.

* test_package makes it easier to run all tests in an installed package. Code
  run in this manner has access to non-exported functions and objects. If any
  errors or failures occur, test_package will throw an error, making it
  suitable for use with R CMD check.

Changes in version 0.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* colourise also works in screen terminal

* equals expectation provides more information about failure

* expect_that has extra info argument to allow you to pass in any extra
  information you'd like included in the message - this is very helpful if
  you're using a loop to run tests

* is_equivalent_to: new expectation that tests for equality ignoring
  attributes

* library_if_available now works! (thanks to report and fix from Felix
  Andrews)

* specify larger width and join pieces back together whenever deparse used
  (thanks to report and fix from Felix Andrews)

* test_dir now looks for any files starting with test (not test- as before)
