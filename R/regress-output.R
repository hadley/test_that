#' Regression test: does output remain unchanged?
#'
#' It is often difficult to define exactly what the printed output should look
#' like, but you know it when you see it, and you want to make sure that it
#' doesn't change by accident. `expect_output_file()` renders function output
#' to a file then throws an error if the output changes.
#'
#' You need to use `expect_output_file()` in conjunction with git or other
#' source code control tool so that you can see exactly what has changed, and
#' revert output to previous versions where needed.
#'
#' @export
#' @param file Path to a "golden" text file that contains the desired output.
#' @param update Should the "golden" text file be updated? Defaults to
#'   `FALSE`, but that it will automatically create output if the file
#'   does not exist (i.e. on the first run).
