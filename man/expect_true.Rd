\title{Expectation: is the object true/false?}
\usage{
expect_true(object, info = NULL, label = NULL)

expect_false(object, info = NULL, label = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{object to test}

\item{info}{extra information to be included in the message (useful when
writing tests in loops).}

\item{label}{object label. When \code{NULL}, computed from deparsed object.}
}
\description{
These are fall-back expectations that you can use when none of the other
more specific expectations apply. The disadvantage is that you may get
a less informative error message.

\examples{
expect_true(2 == 2)
# Failed expectations will throw an error
\dontrun{
expect_true(2 != 2)
}
expect_true(!(2 != 2))
# or better:
expect_false(2 != 2)

a <- 1:3
expect_true(length(a) == 3)
# but better to use more specific expectation, if available
expect_equal(length(a), 3)
