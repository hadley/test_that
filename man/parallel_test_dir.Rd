\usage{
parallel_test_dir(path, filter = NULL, nnodes = detectCores(),
  type = default_cluster_type(), cl = NULL, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{path}{path to tests}

  \item{filter}{forwarded to \code{\link{test_dir}}}

  \item{quiet}{whether to be silent}

  \item{nnodes}{The number of nodes to be forked.}

  \item{type}{One of the supported types: see
  \sQuote{Details}.}

  \item{cl}{an object of class \code{"cluster"}.}
}
\description{
The tests will be parallelized by test file, i.e. each
(matched) individual test file from "path" will be run on a
cluster node.
}
\section{Windows}{
  On platforms that do not implement fork (such as
  Windows), this is much more involved since the user has
  to initialize the cluster nodes properly , e.g. making
  available in the R sessions the R objects and functions
  to be tested. This can be done by first creating a PSOCK
  cluster, then by initializing it, and finally by
  supplying this cluster to this function.
