\arguments{
  \item{path}{path to tests}

  \item{reporter}{reporter to use}

  \item{filter}{If not \code{NULL}, only tests with file
  names matching this regular expression will be executed.
  Matching will take on the file name after it has been
  stripped of \code{"test-"} and \code{".r"}.}

  Test files start with \code{test} and are executed in
  alphabetical order (but they shouldn't have
  dependencies). Helper files start with \code{helper} and
  loaded before any tests are run.
