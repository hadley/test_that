## Parallel testthat (preview)

### Turning on parallel tests

The current development version of testthat supports running test in
parallel, in multiple R subprocesses. To turn on this feature, you
need to set the `TESTTHAT_PARALLEL` environment variable to `true`.

### Number of parallel subprocesses

The number of subprocesses is taken from the `Ncpus` option, if set,
otherwise it is fixed to 4. This will change later, see the TODO list
at <https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/pull/1032>. (But testthat never
starts more subprocesses than the numbr of test files.)

### Test files, test order and state

Testthat starts running the test files in alphabetical order. As soon
as a subprocess has finished with a file, it receives another file to
run from the main process, until all files are done. In general, the
user cannot make any assumptions about the order of the files, and
which subprocess they'll be executed on.

Test files do not start in a clean R process currently. The first *n*
files, where *n* is the number of subprocesses, do start in a clean R
process, but users should not rely on that. In particular, options
(set via `options()` or otherwise) are *not* reset, loaded packages
are *not* unloaded, the global environment is *not* cleared, etc. In
the future the user will be able to request a clean R process for a
test file, see the TODO at
<https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/pull/1032> .

Since files run in alphabetical order, ideally the files that take the
longest to run, should be started first. This way, we can avoid
starting a long running test file on a subprocess, when the other
files have finished already and the other subprocesses have nothing to
do. To achive this, you can name your test files like this:

    test-1-slowest.R
    test-2-next-slowest.R
    ...

### Helper, setup, teardown files

All test subprocesses run the helper files (if requested in
`devtools::test()`, `testthat::test_dir()`, etc.), then they run the
setup files. After the last test file has finished, all subprocesses
run the teardown files.

### Known issues

-   The `location` reporter does not work currently. Any reporter that
    relies on stack traces being present in all test results, will
    fail.
-   The current reporters are not ideal for parallel execution, as
    they cannot handle running multiple files at the same time.
    Parallel testthat tricks the reporters by collecting all results
    for a test file, and then "replaying" them at once. Reporters can
    not show the progress within files. This will be fixed later.
-   Testthat does not handle crashes currently. This will be fixed
    later.
-   You cannot currently use the `env` argument of `test_dir()`, etc.
    Do not set this argument if you use parallel testthat. This will
    be fixed later.
-   Test files that perform many quick expectations might be slow.
    This will be fixed later.
-   Testthat does not currently auto-detect the number of processors.
    This will be fixed later.
-   Parallel testhat currently silently ignores failures in the
    helper, startup and teardown files. This will be fixed later.
-   The process tree cleanup only works on macOS, Windows and Linux
    currently, so parallel testthat only supports these operating
    systems. This will be fixed later.
-   Testthat cannot yet run its own tests in parallel.
